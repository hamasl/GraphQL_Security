# GraphQL_Security
A project for the course TDA 602 Language based security at Chalmers. Projects looks at vulnerabilities in GraphQL, and also how to exploit and patch them.

## Package express-graphql deprecated
NEVER EVER USE THIS package for actual development as it is deprecated. Unfortunately, very little documentation was available online for the alternative graphql-http, making it hard to use. Along, with the main gist of this task being to look at exploitations, it was decided that the deprecated express-graphql would be kept.
